I've spent a couple hours trying to follow the directions outlined on the Github
page linked above, but couldn't seem to get it working.

There's a bounty out there for anyone who can provide me with a clear set of
*"idiot proof"* directions on how to get ECS working. So the first person
that can send me directions, and I'm able to successfully follow them, will
get a prize!
